Boating is fun. The motors widely used to power our water toys are in overwhelming majority internal combustion engines. That doesn't only make boating noisy, it also makes it a water and air polluting hobby. The fuel burnt leaves residue and contributes to global warming.

Revolutionary technology already developed for the automotive sector is now becoming readily available for the marine applications. Clean propulsion though makes the classic boaters raise an eyebrow. Reasons are many, prohibitive price and questionable reliability being amongst the most popular ones.

Hybrid Boating Dot Com is the chopping block for sustainable boat propulsion solutions, allowing stake holders to share their knowledge and experience.

Our waterways will have to become cleaner and we believe that can be done one boat at the time.
